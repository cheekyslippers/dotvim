FIFO Specification
==================



               --------
          8   |        |   8
in     ---/-->|   F    |---/--->  out
              |   I    |
clk_in ------>|   F    |<-------  clk_out
              |   O    |
full   <------|        |------->  empty
              |        |
               --------
                  ^
reset  -----------'



1. FIFO is 8 bits wide
2. FIFO is 16 fields deep
3. Reset is asynchronous and resets the entire FIFO
4. All data is sampled on rising clock edge
5. full is synchronous to clk_in, empty is synchronous to clk_out
6. full is asserted instantanesouly on all 16 fields being utilised
7. full is de-asserted with at least 1 field free
8. empty is de-asserted with at least 1 field entry present in the FIFO
9. empty is asserted instaneously when no entries are present in the FIFO



Given the above specficiation - how would you verify this FIFO?
